# 🎄 Advent of Code — Solutions by Anna Scribner 🎄
Welcome to my Advent of Code repository!

This is where I’m solving the daily programming puzzles released every December. It’s a fun way to practice problem-solving, explore different techniques, and keep improving my coding skills throughout the month.

Thank you!
